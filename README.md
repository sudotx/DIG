## Decentral Initiative Guild

Introducing an expreimental governance wrapper around allocation, and general interaction with specific allo grant vault and registery infrastructure

Overview

Welcome to Decentral Initiative Guild (DIG), your one-stop solution for decentralized grant allocation on the blockchain. DIG is a governance wrapper contract designed to empower initiative creators and knights in managing and executing tasks efficiently and securely.

Although still an EXPERIMENTAL, WORK IN PROGRESS. DIG is set up to leverage all existing features of the Allo protocol

Key Features

    Governance at its Core: DIG utilizes a decentralized governance model that ensures fairness and transparency. Initiative creators can propose tasks, and knights can vote on the allocation of grants.

    Registry Integration: Leveraging Allo as a decentralized database, providing a comprehensive list of initiative creators and knights. This integration ensures a trustless and verifiable environment for participants.

    Smart Contract Security: Leveraging the robust security features of existing protocols, DIG ensures the integrity and safety of funds. Smart contracts are designed to follow best practices and utilize battle-tested security measures.

    Decentralized Task Execution: Knights, the task executors, play a crucial role in the DIG ecosystem. They are incentivized through on-chain payments for successfully completing tasks, fostering an active and engaged community.

    Interoperability: DIG is designed to work seamlessly with existing blockchain protocols, allowing for easy integration and compatibility with various decentralized applications and platforms.

Getting Started

To begin using DIG, follow these steps

    Initiative Creation: Initiative creators propose tasks and allocate grants through the DIG governance system. Clearly outline the scope, deliverables, and grant amount.

    Registry Access: Leveraging the Allo registery to know participants previous history across the Allo ecosystem of grant allocation

    Governance Participation: Knights can participate in the governance process by voting on proposed initiatives. This ensures that the community has a say in the allocation of grants.

    Task Execution: Knights can choose tasks based on their expertise and availability. Upon completion, funds are automatically transferred to their wallets, creating a seamless and trustless payment process.

Ideals

DIG hopes to incorporate practices around

    Smart Contract Audits: All components will always be availalble for any member to audit the code, and fund structure setup by the Knights, Guardians and any Protocol Custodian.

    Decentralized Identity: The registry ensures that all participants are verified and have a decentralized identity, adding an additional layer of security.

    Permissionless Access: DIG is designed to be permissionless, ensuring that anyone can participate.

Roadmap

    Phase 1 - MVP Development: Implement core features, including the registry, governance, and task execution.

    Phase 2 - Continued MVP Development based on feedback from Community, Current Industry Players

    Phase 3 - Audit: Conduct comprehensive security audits to ensure the robustness of the system.

    Phase 4 - Mainnet Launch: Deploy DIG on the mainnet, allowing users to actively participate in the decentralized governance and grant allocation process.
